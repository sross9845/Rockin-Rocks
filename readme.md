## What this is all about/Final Thoughts

This was my final project for my time at General Assembly. I took on and learned VueJS on my own and completed the initial app in a week. The project is based on the beautiful trend of Pet Rocks. I decided to bring them back and learn how to make a basic E-Commerce site to  learn how all of that works. My take aways from Vue is that it is AWESOME. I absolutely love Vue. If I had more of an angular background I might have had less snags throughout the week.
Overall this was one of my favorite projects.

## The Week

### Day -1 to Day 2
The first few days was spent having my mind blown by Vue. This framework absolutely blew my mind with what it could do. It took alot of the good thing from react and some of the good things I hear about from angular and put them into this beautiful framework. I spent the night before the project doing a To-Do-List tutorial to see how I liked Vue and if I should take it on for the week and obviously I fell in love with it. 

### Day 3
Day three was just planning out my data. I have never made an e-commerce site before so making a site like this was going to be a new challenge for me. Figuring out my data models was going to be crucial moving forward. I decided to use a boolean to keep track if the order is completed or not. I then made a call to check for the order that matches the User ID and if the boolean is false. After I got that figured out it was smooth sailing with my data.

### Day 4
Day four was getting my bootstrap styling figured out. I made a seeder file with all of my rock products so I had some data to work with. I took a deep dive into bootstrap for the first time. It was a learning curve but I see the appeal. This made my site easier to look at while I banged my head against the table occasionally when learning Vue.

### Day 5 and Day 6
This was time to get it together and make an app happen. I took a large deep dive into vue and into my caffeine addiction. Vue was awesome 90% of the time and not so awesome to learn 10% of the time. I could usually use my normal react tricks but occaisonally had to get pretty creative. I at the end of it all needed a checkout screen so I looked into stripe. Then looked into how people intergrated this into Vue with Node and found a few examples. I got it to mostly work atleast enough to verfiy that the test card infact works.
